# Bypasses
---
Bypasses are different ways the bot can ignore whether to check a message for blacklisted words or not, you can bypass by user id, which means that in any channel in the server, that user will never have the bot scan their messages for blacklisted words.

### Bypass Type: User
Adding a user bypass means that the user will never be flagged by the bot and their messages will never be removed by the bot if they have one or more blacklisted words in them.
### Bypass Type: Channel
Independant of user, an entire channel can be bypasses, this means the bot will ignore anything sent in that channel. For Example if you have an 18+ Channel, you can allow swearing in just that channel if you so desire.
### Bypass Type: Role
Works very similar to a user bypass but instead it allows a group of users instead of just one.
can save a lot of time and effort if you're planning on allowing a lot of bypasses to users.
